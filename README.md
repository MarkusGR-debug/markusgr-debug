## 🔬 Projects & Highlights

### 🕶️ Generative AI for Accessibility – HoloLens2  
A native application built for the HoloLens2 that helps visually impaired users recognize and identify faces in real time using YOLOv8.  
👉 [Project Repo (Coming Soon)]()  

### 🧭 Search and Rescue Robot (SLAM + A*)  
Developed an AI strategy using Anki Cozmo to navigate and map unknown environments. Integrated SLAM and A* algorithm for optimized pathfinding.  
📝 Based on my coursework and robotics experiments.

### 🌐 AI-Powered Itinerary Planner  
Led a team project that uses AI and a Python-built chatbot to help users—especially those with disabilities—plan trips interactively. The chatbot provides route estimates, attraction info, and accessibility support.  
🌍 Web interface: HTML/CSS/Java | AI: Python  

### 📉 Data Science on House Prices & Broadband  
Processed public datasets (house prices, broadband, council tax) using **SQL**, **R**, and **XML**. Normalized to 3NF, created relational diagrams, and built insightful data summaries.  

### 🎵 Music Recommendation & Recognition  
- 📻 Recommendation system using collaborative filtering  
- 🎶 Song recognition using signal processing and ML  
- 🛠️ Python, Numpy, Librosa, Scikit-learn  

### 🚗 Machine Vision for Autonomous Vehicles  
Used Oxford Brookes ROAD dataset to classify road signs and detect driving environments via CNNs.  
🧠 Explored edge detection, environment segmentation, and accuracy boosting techniques.
